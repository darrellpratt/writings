# So you want to be a DevOps engineer
The DevOps movement has come about to accomplish the long sought after goal of removing the barriers between the traditional development and operations organizations. Historically, the development teams have written the code for an application and passed that code over to the operations team to both test and deploy onto the company’s servers. This practice generates many mistakes and mis-understandings in the software development lifecycle, in addition to the lack of ownership amongst developers that grows as a result of them not owning more of the deployment pipeline and production responsibilities.

The new DevOps teams that are appearing now start as blended groups of developers, system administrators and release engineers. The thought being that the developers can assist the operations team members in the process of building and more deeply understanding the applications and the operations team member can shed light on the environments and deployment processes that they must master to keep the applications running. As these teams evolve, we are seeing the trend to specifically hire people into the role of the DevOps Engineer.

What this role is and what type of skills one might need to succeed as a DevOps engineer is what we will cover in this article.

## The Basics
Almost every job description you are going to find for a DevOps engineer is going to require some level of proficiency in the desired production operating systems.  Linux is probably the most common. You will need to have a very good level of understanding of how to administer and use a linux based machine.  Words like grep, sed, awk, chmod, chown, ifconfig, netstat and others should not scare you. In the role of DevOps engineer you are the goto person for the developers when they have issues with the server, local or cloud.

Learn the package manager systems for the various distributions of Linux to better understand the underpinnings of how they work.  From RPM and Yum to Apt and Apk, the managers vary widely but the common ideas are very similar in each. You should understand how to use the managers to script machine configurations and understand how the modern containers are built.

## Coding 
The type of language one needs for a DevOps role is going to depend quite a bit on the particular company. Java, C#, JavaScript, Ruby and Python are all popular languages. If you are a devout Java follower then choosing a .NET shop might not be your best choice.  Use your discretion here, but the job is going to require a working knowledge of coding in one more focused languages.

## Cloud Management 
Gone are the days of uploading a war file to a directory on the server. It’s very likely that you are going to be responsible for getting applications up and running on a cloud provider. Amazon Web Services is the gorilla in the space and having a good level of hands on experience with the various services that make up a standard AWS deployment is a much sought after skill set. From standard AMIs to load balancing, cloud formation and security groups, AWS can be complicated but luckily it is very inexpensive to experiment and there are many training classes of the different components.

## Source Code Control
Git is the tool of choice currently for source code control. Git   gives a team a decentralized SCM system that is built to handle branching and merging operations with ease. Workflows that teams use are varied, but a good understanding of how to merge branches, rebase and fix commit issues is required in the role. The DevOps engineers are usually looked to for help on addressing “interesting” git issues, so good, hands-on experience is vital.

## Automation Tooling
A new automation tool has probably been released in the time it takes to read this article. There will be new tools and platforms in this part of the DevOps space, but the most common are Chef, Puppet and Ansible. Each system provides a framework for treating the setup and maintenance of your infrastructure as code. Each system has a slightly different take on the method for writing the configurations and deploying them, but the concepts are similar and a good background in any one of these is more often than not a requirement for any DevOps role. Each of these systems also requires a good understanding of either Ruby or Python and these languages appear quite a bit in the various tools used in the DevOps space.

## Conclusion
While not an exhaustive list, mastering this set of skills will accelerate anyone’s journey towards becoming a DevOps engineer.
